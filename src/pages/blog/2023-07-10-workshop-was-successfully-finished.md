On 9 July 2023, the first IEEE ISCC Workshop on Optical Wireless Communications (OWC’23) took place in Gamarth, Tunisia.

Approximately 30 people attended the workshop, and we had five oral presentations from established researchers and young scientists. We had a very fruitful discussion among the presenters and audience, so the workshop was very successful.

The keynote, presented by Prof. Yamazato, was also very informative. He kindly allows us to share his slide with us, which you will find on the [program page](../program/).

Thank you very much to all our presenters and participants.

Last but not least, we would like to extend our gratitude to our TCP members and our co-chairs, Dr. Takaya Yamazato (Nagoya University), Dr. Chedlia Ben Naila (Nagoya University), Dr. Anna Maria Vegni (Roma Tre University), and Dr. Hanaa Abumarshoud (University of Glasgow). Without their tireless efforts, unwavering dedication, and team spirit were integral to the success of this workshop, and we are grateful for your contribution.
